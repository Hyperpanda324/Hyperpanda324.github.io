# Destiny Zeng SE Freshman Seminar page
My name is Destiny Zeng and I'm from northern Virginia where I went to Potomac Falls High School. I have one older brother that's either 22 or 23 (I can't remember) and an older sister that I believe is 27. Everyone in my family does art as me and my siblings each do and want to do something with art, with my sister pursuing being a CGI artist and my brother pursuing being a merchandise artist. My only hobbbies is drawing and playing video games and I love doing art and I do a lot of digital art and want to become an independent video game developer after college. That's mainly why I'm pursuing software engineering so I can learn the programming skills as I already have a good understanding of the art and design aspects of video games. Also so I can still succesfully get a good full time job after school to support myself so I can actually pursue my dreams and not be broke, as my dreams would not be able to support me in the beginning as success in this field is very hard. My favorite type of games are rouge lite/like and platformer games and I also like a lot of indie games. My favorite games would probably be Warframe, Risk of Rain 2, Dead Cells, Eastward, and the Ace Attourney series but I have a lot of other games I really like.
